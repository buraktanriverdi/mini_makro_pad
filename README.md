## Usage

This mini macro pad works with the Arduino Pro Micro and operates with pre-loaded code. Modifications and new code uploads can be done using the Arduino IDE.
Uploading and Making Changes (with Arduino IDE)

    Arduino IDE Installation: Make sure the Arduino IDE is installed on your computer. You can download it from the Arduino Official Website.

    Connection: Connect the Arduino Pro Micro to your computer.
    
    Uploading Code: Open the Arduino IDE, import the project file, and upload the code to the Arduino Pro Micro.
    
    Making Changes: Edit the code as desired and save your changes. Then upload the modified code to the Arduino Pro Micro.

## Usage Without Arduino IDE

This mini macro pad is pre-programmed and can be used directly by connecting it to a computer to perform Ctrl+C, Ctrl+V, and Ctrl+Z functions without the need for Arduino IDE.
Notes

    Follow the above steps to modify the code or upload new code using the Arduino IDE.
    Without the Arduino IDE, the device can be used directly with pre-loaded code.
